# Bloggers-Park

started app
added app in settings.py
created models
made model migrations and migrated
include/import the model in admin.py to access them
register the imported models via admin.site.register(Model)
created a superuser via manage.py createsuperuser to get access as admin
run server to check if admin includes those models
added a Model(post in this case) from admin - created an INSTANCE/OBJECT
deplyment:
set up git, github
added a .git folder and .gitignore
we added db.sqlite in gitignore as we'll use the server of pythonanywhere
setting up git and linking files to github repo
working with bash
api token added from pythonanywhere. deployed.
Urls:
made a seperate urls.py to keep the urls of the app at one place
listed out the urls at that script
include them with main urls.py using path('', include(package.module)) so when '' address is requested django looks at blog/urls.py for urlconfigs using path ('/url', view, name = 'urlname')
views: the logic that that connects models with templates
defined a view
added a template\blog directory inside the app directory
made a landing template
